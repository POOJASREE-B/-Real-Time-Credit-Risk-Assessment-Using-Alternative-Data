# Real-Time Credit Risk Assessment with Blockchain Insights and Fraud Detection

### A dynamic, real-time credit risk system that seamlessly integrates traditional financial data, blockchain insights, and alternative data to predict creditworthiness, while proactively detecting and preventing fraud through advanced AI-driven analytics

## Overview

This system provides **real-time credit risk assessment** by analyzing a combination of **traditional financial data**, **alternative data sources**, and **cryptocurrency transaction activity**. It enables financial institutions to accurately predict creditworthiness while simultaneously detecting and preventing **fraud** in digital banking environments. The integration of **blockchain insights**, such as cryptocurrency wallet transactions and holdings, enhances the **persona creation** and **risk scoring**, making the system more dynamic and inclusive. The system also integrates **advanced fraud detection algorithms** to protect against unauthorized transactions, account takeovers, and other types of financial fraud.

## Features

- **Real-Time Credit Risk Scoring**: The system uses **traditional financial data** (credit scores, income, spending habits) and **alternative data** (social media sentiment, utility payments, cryptocurrency activity) to generate a comprehensive credit risk score.
  
- **Blockchain Insights**: The system analyzes **cryptocurrency wallet balances**, **trading patterns**, and **transaction stability** to provide a more accurate, real-time creditworthiness assessment.
  
- **Fraud Detection**: The system employs **real-time fraud detection algorithms** to identify suspicious activities like **unauthorized transactions**, **account takeovers**, and **unusual financial behavior**.

- **Explainable AI**: The use of **Explainable AI (XAI)** tools like **SHAP** and **LIME** ensures transparency and enables users and institutions to understand how different data points contribute to their credit risk scores and fraud alerts.

- **Real-Time Alerts and Monitoring**: Users and financial institutions receive instant alerts for **suspicious activities**, and the system adapts to **dynamic financial behaviors** to improve accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: For training models to predict creditworthiness and fraud detection.
  - Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Isolation Forest, Neural Networks
  - Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch

- **Blockchain Analysis**: To track **cryptocurrency transactions**, analyze **wallet balances**, and detect patterns from the **public ledger**.
  - APIs: Etherscan, CoinGecko, and custom blockchain analysis tools

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: To perform **social media sentiment analysis**.
  - Libraries: NLTK, SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers

- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: To process transactions and alerts in real-time.
  - Technologies: Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, or Streamlit


## System Workflow

### 1. Data Collection & Aggregation
- Collect data from **traditional financial sources** (credit scores, transaction history, utility payments).
- Gather data from **alternative sources** (social media sentiment, geolocation data).
- Integrate **cryptocurrency transaction data** from public blockchain sources (Etherscan, CoinGecko, etc.).

### 2. Persona Creation & Risk Scoring
- Develop **financial personas** by combining traditional data with **blockchain insights** and **alternative data**.
- Use machine learning models to predict creditworthiness based on a combination of factors, such as:
  - **Crypto wallet balance**
  - **Frequency of cryptocurrency transactions**
  - **Social media sentiment**
  - **Utility payment consistency**
  - **Income and spending behavior**

### 3. Real-Time Fraud Detection
- Monitor transactions for **anomalous activity** that might indicate fraud (e.g., unusual crypto activity, suspicious account access).
- Employ **machine learning-based anomaly detection** and **predictive analytics** to identify and flag potential fraud.
- Trigger **instant alerts** when fraud is detected (e.g., unauthorized transactions, sudden changes in account details).

### 4. Explainable AI for Transparency
- Use **SHAP** or **LIME** to explain how each data point (e.g., crypto wallet activity, social media sentiment) contributes to the **credit risk score** and **fraud alert**.
- Provide detailed explanations for users and institutions to understand how the model arrives at its conclusions.

### 5. Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts
- Real-time monitoring of users' financial behaviors across both **traditional and decentralized financial systems**.
- Instant notifications for **suspicious transactions**, **changes in credit risk scores**, and **potential fraud events**.

## Example Use Case

**User Persona: John Doe**
- John has a **good credit score** but lacks a history of traditional borrowing (e.g., no loans, limited credit card usage).
- However, John has an **active cryptocurrency portfolio** with frequent trading activity and holds **stable assets**.
- He also posts about **financial activities** on social media and maintains regular utility bill payments.
  
The system will combine **Johnâ€™s crypto transaction history**, **social media sentiment**, and **utility payment history** to predict his **creditworthiness**. It will flag any unusual crypto transactions or social media posts as **suspicious**, raising a fraud alert in real time.

## CODE

### Data collection
```
import requests
import pandas as pd

def fetch_crypto_data(wallet_address):
    """Fetch crypto wallet balance and transaction count."""
    api_key = "YourAPIKey"  # Replace with your API key
    base_url = "https://api.etherscan.io/api"
    
    # Wallet balance
    balance_url = f"{base_url}?module=account&action=balance&address={wallet_address}&apikey={api_key}"
    balance_response = requests.get(balance_url)
    balance = int(balance_response.json()["result"]) / 1e18  # Convert Wei to ETH
    
    # Transaction count
    tx_url = f"{base_url}?module=account&action=txlist&address={wallet_address}&apikey={api_key}"
    tx_response = requests.get(tx_url)
    transactions = tx_response.json()["result"]
    transaction_count = len(transactions)
    
    return balance, transaction_count

# Example: Fetch crypto data for wallets
wallet_addresses = ["0xSampleWallet1", "0xSampleWallet2"]
crypto_data = [fetch_crypto_data(wallet) for wallet in wallet_addresses]
df_crypto = pd.DataFrame(crypto_data, columns=["crypto_wallet_balance", "crypto_transaction_count"])

```
### Combine Traditional and Alternative Data
```
# Traditional financial data
df_traditional = pd.DataFrame({
    "user_id": [1, 2],
    "credit_score": [720, 580],
    "income": [6000, 3000],
    "utility_payment_consistency": [1.0, 0.6],
})

# Combine datasets
df_combined = pd.concat([df_traditional, df_crypto], axis=1)
print(df_combined)

```

### Feature Engineering

```
df_combined["crypto_stability"] = df_combined["crypto_wallet_balance"] / (df_combined["crypto_transaction_count"] + 1)
df_combined["income_to_balance_ratio"] = df_combined["income"] / (df_combined["crypto_wallet_balance"] + 1)
```

### Model

```
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Target variable
df_combined["default_risk"] = [0, 1]  # 0 = No Default, 1 = Default

# Split data
X = df_combined[["credit_score", "income", "utility_payment_consistency", 
                 "crypto_wallet_balance", "crypto_transaction_count", 
                 "crypto_stability", "income_to_balance_ratio"]]
y = df_combined["default_risk"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

# Train Random Forest Classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```
### Explainable AI

# SHAP Explainer
explainer = shap.Explainer(model, X_test)
shap_values = explainer(X_test)

# Visualize feature importance
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test, plot_type="bar")

# Explain a single prediction
shap.plots.waterfall(shap_values[0])
```
### Risk assesment
```
def real_time_risk(wallet_address, model):
    """Calculate real-time credit risk for a new wallet."""
    balance, tx_count = fetch_crypto_data(wallet_address)
    new_data = pd.DataFrame([{
        "credit_score": 700,  # Example default value

        "crypto_stability": balance / (tx_count + 1),
        "income_to_balance_ratio": 5000 / (balance + 1),
    }])
    risk_score = model.predict_proba(new_data)[0][1]
    return risk_score

# Example usage
new_wallet = "0xSampleWallet1"
risk_score = real_time_risk(new_wallet, model)
print(f"Real-Time Credit Risk Score: {risk_score:.2f}")

```
